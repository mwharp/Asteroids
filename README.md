# Asteroids
An Asteroids game coded in Java

I've always dreamed of getting into the video game industry, so creating a game like "Asteroids" was a lot of fun, and I learned a ton from it. With this assignement I had to figure out how each file and object communicated with eachother to make the game, such as when a bullet hits an asteroid, or when you run out of lives. It was a long project that took over a month to complete, but with getting help from my teacher when I was stuck on the project or had questions, using the correct data structures, and debugging, I was able to complete this assignment with flying colors.
